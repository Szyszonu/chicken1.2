        <p>This Chicken Alfredo features pasta drenched in an ultra-rich and creamy sauce and topped with juicy strips of seared chicken.</p>

        alt="Slow Cooker BBQ Chicken">
    
        <p>This is the time of year when I start to avoid turning on the oven at all costs. So what's for dinner when it's too hot to cook? Slow Cooker BBQ Chicken! You can have this tasty chicken in the slow cooker doing its own thing while you're enjoying a lazy summer day.</p>

        alt="Creamy pesto Chicken">
    
        <p>I love using pesto in recipes because it adds tons of flavor in one fell swoop, which is super important when it comes to busy weeknights. This Creamy pesto Chicken is absolutely stunning on the plate, yet it's super fast and easy. This is another one of those great “date night” dinners for when you want to impress someone, but you're nervous so you also need something easy and fool-proof.</p>

        alt="Chicken stew">
    
        <p>Chicken stew is like chicken soup's older cousin that is a little rough around the edges. It's a little more rustic with a rich, thickened broth that has an almost gravy-like consistency. It's packed full of vegetables and is a true meal in a bowl. Oh, and you'll definitely want some crusty bread for sopping up all that delicious gravy!</p>

        alt="Balsamic Chicken and Mushrooms">
    
        <p>I served my Balsamic Chicken and Mushrooms with Garlic Herb Mashed Potatoes and some steamed green beans. The buttery balsamic sauce would also pair beautifully with Browned Butter Mashed Sweet Potatoes, Roasted Asparagus and Tomatoes, Roasted Vegetable Couscous, or Grilled Vegetable Pasta Salad.</p>

        alt="Spicy Glazed Chicken Thighs">
        
        <p>My Glazed Pork Chops recipe has been viral for several years because it's ridiculously easy, super tasty, and the sweet and spicy glaze helps keep the pork chops nice and moist. While I've often told people that the glaze works just as well on chicken, I had yet to showcase that particular combo on the blog. Until now. And honestly, I might even like these Sweet and Spicy Glazed Chicken Thighs better than the pork chops because they're inherently even more tender and juicy, which means they reheat well and are absolutely perfect for meal prep. ;)</p>
